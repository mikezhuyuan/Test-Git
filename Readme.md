Quick start
===========

If you don't want to contribute to this project and you know git and maven, these build instructions should suffice:

* To build 1 repository, for example `guvnor`:

        $ git clone git@github.com:droolsjbpm/guvnor.git
        $ cd guvnor
        $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

* To build all repositories:

        $ git clone git@github.com:droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap.git
        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-clone-others.sh
        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh clean install -DskipTests

Source control with Git
=======================

Installing and configuring git
------------------------------

* Install it in your OS:

    * Linux: Install the package git

            $ sudo apt-get install git

        Tip: Also install *gitk* to visualize your git log:

            $ sudo apt-get install gitk

    * Windows, Mac OSX: Download from [the git website](http://git-scm.com).

        Tip for Mac OSX: Also install [*gitx*](http://gitx.frim.nl/) to visualize your git log.

    * More info [in github's git installation instructions](http://help.github.com/git-installation-redirect).

* Check if git is installed correctly.

        $ git --version
        git version 1.7.1

* Configure git correctly:

        $ git config --global user.name "My Full Name"
        $ git config --global user.email myAccount@gmail.com
        $ git config --global -l
        user.name=Geoffrey De Smet
        user.email=gds...@gmail.com

    * Warning: the field `user.name` is your full name, *not your username*.

    * Note: the field `user.email` should match an email address of your github account.

    * More info on [github](http://help.github.com/git-email-settings/).

* Get a github account

    * And add your public key on github: [Follow these instructions](http://github.com/guides/providing-your-ssh-key).

* To learn more about git, read the free book [Git Pro](http://progit.org/book/).

Getting the sources locally
---------------------------

Because you 'll probably want to change our code, it's recommended to fork our code before cloning it,
so it's easier to share your changes with us later.
For more info on forking, read [Github's help on forking](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/).

* First fork the repository you want to work on, for example `guvnor`:

    * Surf to [the blessed repositories on github](https://github.com/droolsjbpm) and log in.

        * Note: **Every git repository can be build alone.**
        You only need to fork/clone the repositories you're interested in (`guvnor` in this case).

    * Surf to [the specific repository (`guvnor`)](https://github.com/droolsjbpm/guvnor)

    * Click the top right button *Fork*

    * Note: by forking the repository, you can commit and push your changes without our consent
    and we can easily review and then merge your changes into the blessed repository.

* **Clone your fork locally:**

        # First make a directory to hold all the droolsjbpm projects
        $ mkdir droolsjbpm
        $ cd droolsjbpm

        # Then clone the repository you want to clone.
        $ git clone git@github.com:MY_GITHUB_USERNAME/guvnor.git
        $ cd guvnor
        $ ls

    * Warning: Always clone with the *SSH URL*, never clone with the *HTTPS URL* because the latter is unreliable.

    * Note: it's highly recommended to name the cloned directory the same as the repository (which is the default), so the helper scripts work.

    * By default you will be looking at the sources of the master branch, which can be very unstable.

        * Use git checkout to switch to a more stable branch or tag:

                $ git checkout 5.2.0.Final

* Add the blessed repository as upstream (if you've directly cloned the blessed repository, don't do this):

        $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:droolsjbpm/guvnor.git
        $ git fetch upstream

Working with git
----------------

* First make a topic branch:

        $ git checkout master
        $ git checkout -b myFirstTopic

    * Don't litter your local `master` branch: keep it equal to `remotes/upstream/master`

    * 1 branch can have only 1 pull request, because the pull requests evolves as you add more commits on that branch.

* Make changes, run, test and document them, then commit them:

        $ git commit -m"Fix typo in documentation"

* Push those commits on your topic branch to your fork

        $ git push myFirstTopic

* Get the latest changes from the blessed repository

    * Set your master equal to the blessed master:

            $ git fetch upstream
            $ git checkout master
            # Warning: this deletes all changes/commits on your local master branch, but you shouldn't have any!
            $ git reset --hard upstream/master

    * Start a new topic branch and set the code the same as the blessed master:

        $ git fetch upstream && git checkout -b mySecondTopic && git reset --hard upstream/master

    * If you have a long-running topic branch, merge master into it:

            $ git fetch upstream
            $ git merge upstream/master

        * If there are merge conflicts:

                $ git mergetool
                $ git commit

            or

                $ git status
                $ gedit conflicted-file.txt
                $ git add conflicted-file.txt
                $ git commit

            Many people get confused when a merge conflict occurs, because you're *in limbo*.
            Just fix the merge conflicts and commit (even if the git seems to contain many files),
            only then is the merge over. Then run `git log` to see what happened.
            The many files in the merge conflict resolving commit are a side-affect of non-linear history.

* Tips and tricks

    * To see the details of your local, unpushed commits:

            $ git diff origin...HEAD

    * To run a git command (except clone) over all repositories (only works if you cloned all repositories):

            $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm
            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh push

        * Note: the `git-all.sh` script is working directory independent.

        * Linux tip: Create a symbolic link to the `git-all.sh` script and place it in your `PATH` by linking it in `~/bin`:

                $ ln -s ~/projects/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh ~/bin/droolsjbpm-git

            For command line completion, add the following line in `~/.bashrc`:

                $ complete -o bashdefault -o default -o nospace -F _git droolsjbpm-git

Share your changes with a pull request
--------------------------------------

A pull request is like a patch file, but easier to apply, more powerful and you'll be credited as the author.

* Creating a pull request

    * Push all your commits to a topic branch on your fork on github (if you haven't already).

        * You can only have 1 pull request per branch, so it's advisable to use topic branches to avoid mixing your changes.

    * Surf to that topic branch on your fork on github.

    * Click the button *Pull Request* on the top of the page.

* Accepting a pull request

    * Surf to the pull request page on github.

    * Review the changes

    * Click the button *Merge help* on the bottom of the page and follow the instructions of github to apply those changes on the blessed master.

        * Or use the button *Merge* if there are no merge conflicts.

Building with Maven
===================

All projects use Maven 3 to build all their modules.

Installing Maven
----------------

* Get Maven

    * [Download Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and follow the installation instructions.

* Linux

    * Note: the `apt-get` version of maven is probably not up-to-date enough.

    * Linux trick to easily upgrade to future versions later:

        * Unzip maven to `~/opt/build`
    
        * Create a version-independent link:

                $ cd ~/opt/build/
                $ ln -s apache-maven-3.0.3 apache-maven

            Next time you only have to remove the link and recreate the link to the new version.

        * Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:

                export M3_HOME="~/opt/build/apache-maven"
                export PATH="$M3_HOME/bin:$PATH"

    * Give more memory to maven, so it can the big projects too:

        * Add this to your `~/.bashrc` file:

            export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

* Windows:

    * Give more memory to maven, so it can the big projects too:

        * Open menu *Configuration screen*, menu item *System*, tab *Advanced*, button *environment variables*:

            set MAVEN_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m"

* Check if maven is installed correctly.

        $ mvn --version
        Apache Maven 3.0.3 (...)
        Java version: 1.6.0_24

    Note: the enforcer plugin enforces a minimum maven and java version.

Running the build
-----------------

* Go into a project's base directory, for example `guvnor`:

        $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm
        $ ls
        drools  droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap  droolsjbpm-build-distribution  droolsjbpm-integration  droolsjbpm-knowledge  droolsjbpm-tools  drools-planner  guvnor
        $ cd guvnor
        $ ls
        ...  guvnor-repository  guvnor-webapp  pom.xml

    Notice you see a `pom.xml` file there. Those `pom.xml` files are the heart of Maven.

* **Run the build**:

        $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

    The first build will take a long time, because a lot of dependencies will be downloaded (and cached locally).

    It might even fail, if certain servers are offline or experience hiccups.
    In that case, you 'll see an IO error, so just run the build again.

    After the first successful build, any next build should be fast and stable.

* Try running a different profile by using the option `-D<profileActivationProperty>`:

        $ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dfull

    There are 3 profile activation properties:

    * *none*: Fast, for during development

    * `full`: Slow, but builds everything (including documentation). Used by hudson and during releases.

    * `soa`: prunes away the non-enterprise stuff

* To run a maven build over all repositories (only works if you cloned all repositories):

        $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm
        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh -DskipTests clean install

    * Note: the `mvn-all.sh` script is working directory independent.

* Warning: The first `mvn` build of a day will download the latest SNAPSHOT dependencies of other droolsjbpm projects,
unless you build all those droolsjbpm projects from source.
Those SNAPSHOTS were build and deployed last night by hudson jobs.

    * If you 've pulled all changes (or cloned a repository) today, this is a good thing:
    it saves you from having to download and build all those other latest droolsjbpm projects from source.

    * If you haven't pulled all changes today, this is probably a bad thing:
    you 're probably not ready to deal with those new snapshots.

        In that case, add `-nsu` (= `--no-snapshot-updates`) to the `mvn` command to avoid downloading those snapshots:

            $ mvn clean install -DskipTests -nsu

        Note that using `-nsu` will also make the build faster.


Running tests
-------------

Guvnor uses Arquillian to run tests in a J2EE container and hence tests need to be ran differently to others.

* Guvnor

        $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm/guvnor/guvnor-webapp-drools
        $ mvn integration-test [-Dtest=ATestClassName]

* All other modules

        $ cd ~/projects/droolsjbpm/drools
        $ mvn test [-Dtest=ATestClassName]


Configuring Maven
-----------------

To deploy snapshots and releases to nexus, you need to add this to the file `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

     <settings>
       ...
       <servers>
         <server>
           <id>jboss-snapshots-repository</id>
           <username>jboss.org_username</username>
           <password>jboss.org_password</password>
         </server>
         <server>
           <id>jboss-releases-repository</id>
           <username>jboss.org_username</username>
           <password>jboss.org_password</password>
         </server>
       </servers>
       ...
     </settings>

Furthermore, you'll need nexus rights to be able to do this.

More info in [the JBoss.org guide to get started with Maven](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/MavenGettingStarted-Developers).

Developing with Eclipse
=======================

Before running Eclipse
----------------------

* Do not use an Eclipse version older than `3.6 (helios)`.

* Avoid an `OutOfMemoryException` and a `StackOverflowError` when building.

    Open `$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclipse.ini` and add/change this: on openFile -vmargs:

        openFile
        -vmargs
        ...
        -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
        -Xms512m
        -Xmx1024m
        -Xss1024k

* Only on Mac, also add these lines to avoid a Mac-specific p2 bug with tycho 0.11.0 in droolsjbpm-tools:

        -startup
        ../../../plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.1.0.v20100507.jar
        --launcher.library
        ../../../plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.cocoa.macosx.x86_64_1.1.1.R36x_v20100810

    TODO: Remove this note when we upgrade to tycho 0.12.0 (if that uses a p2 director that fixes it)

Configuring the project with the m2eclipse plugin
-------------------------------------------------

The m2eclipse plugin is a plugin in Eclipse for Maven.
This is the new way (and compatible with tycho).

* Open Eclipse

* Follow [the installation instructions of m2eclipse](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/).

    * Follow the link *Installing m2eclipse* at the bottom.

* Click menu *File*, menu item *Import*, tree item *Maven*, tree item *Existing Maven Projects*.

* Click button *Browse*, select a repository directory. For example `~/projects/droolsjbpm/guvnor`.

* Unfold *Advanced*, textfield *Profiles*: `notSoaProfile,fullProfile`.

For more information, see [the m2eclipse book](http://www.sonatype.com/books/m2eclipse-book/reference/)

Configuring the project with the deprecated maven-eclipse-plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------

The maven-eclipse-plugin plugin is a plugin in Maven for Eclipse.
This is the old way (of which the development has stopped).

Run this command to generate `.project` and `.classpath` files:

    $ mvn eclipse:eclipse

* Open Eclipse

* Menu item *Import existing projects*, navigate to the project base directory, select all the projects (= modules) it lists.

Important note: `mvn eclipse:eclipse` does not work for our eclipse plugins because it is not compatible with tycho
(and never will be).

Configuring Eclipse
-------------------

* Force language level 5 (not 6), to fail-fast on implemented interface methods that are annotated with `@Override`.

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*

    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Compiler*, section *JDK Compliance*, combobox *Compiler compliance level* should be `1.5`.

* Remove the test resources Java Build Path exclusion filter to ensure JUnit tests ran inside Eclipse can find the necessary resources.

    * Right-click the project

    * Select menu item *Build Path*, sub-menu item *Configure build path...*

    * On the *Sources* tab, scroll down to `<project>\src\test\resources` and expand tree

    * Select `Excluded` and click *Remove*. The filter should show as `(none)` 

* Set the correct file encoding (UTF-8 except for properties files) and end-of-line characters (unix):

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.

    * Click tree item *General*, tree item *Workspace*

        * Label *Text file encoding*, radiobutton *Other*, combobox `UTF-8`.

        * Label *New text file delimiter*, radiobutton *Other*, combobox `Unix`.

    * Click tree item *XML*, tree item *XML Files*.

        * Combobox *Encoding*: `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

    * Click tree item *CSS*, tree item *CSS Files*.

        * Combobox *Encoding*: `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

    * Open tree item *HTML*, tree item *HTML Files*.

        * Combobox *Encoding*: `ISO 10646/Unicode(UTF-8)`.

    * Note: normal i18n properties files must be in `ISO-8859-1` as specified by the java `ResourceBundle` contract.

        * Note on note: GWT i18n properties files override that and must be in `UTF-8` as specified by the GWT contract.

* Set the correct number of spaces when pressing tab:

    * Warning: If you imported the `eclipse-formatter.xml` file, you don't need to set it for Java, but you do need to set it for XML anyway!

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.

        * If you have project specific settings enabled instead, right click on the project and click the menu item *Properties*.

    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Code Style*, tree item *Formatter*.

        * Click button *Edit* of the active profile, tab *Indentation*

        * Combobox *Tab policy*: `spaces only`

        * Textfield *Indentation size*: `4`

        * Textfield *Tab size*: `4`

        * Note: If it is a build-in profile, you 'll need to change its name with the textfield on top.

    * Click tree item *XML*, tree item *XML Files*, tree item *Editor*.

        * Radiobutton *Indent using space*: `on`

        * Textfield *Indentation size*: `2`

* Set the correct file headers (do not include @author or a meaningless javadoc):

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.
    
    * Click tree item *Java*, tree item *Code Style*, tree item *Code Templates*.

    * Click tree *Configure generated code and comments*, tree item *Comments*, tree item *types*.

    * Remove the line *@author Your Name*.

        * We do not accept `@author` lines in source files, see FAQ below.

    * Remove the entire javadoc as automatically templated data is meaningless.

* Set the correct license header

    Eclipse JEE Helios currently has no build-in support of license headers, but you can configure it for new files.

    * Open menu *Window*, menu item *Preferences*.

        * If you have project specific settings enabled instead, right click on the project and click the menu item *Properties*.

    * In your workspace, in the tab *Development Mode*, double click on the `Guvnor` URL.

    * If you encounter a java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: warningThreshold error you need to follow the steps [here](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/detail?id=4479), i.e. 

        * Add GWT-SDK to your classpath (even though it is a Maven dependency)

        * On your Java Build Path, Order and Export tab, move GWT-SDK to the top

Eclipse plugin development
--------------------------

* Installing a droolsjbpm eclipse plugin into a fresh Eclipse from a local update site.

    * Follow the intructions in [the description entity in the org.drools.updatesite pom.xml file](https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-tools/blob/master/drools-eclipse/org.drools.updatesite/pom.xml).

Developing with IntelliJ
========================

Before running IntelliJ
-----------------------

* Avoid an `OutOfMemoryException` while editing or building.

    Open `$IDEA_HOME/bin/idea.vmoptions` and change the first 3 values to this:

        -Xms512m
        -Xmx1024m
        -XX:MaxPermSize=512m

Configuring the project with the maven integration
--------------------------------------------------

IntelliJ has very good build-in support for Maven.

* Open IntelliJ.

* Click menu *File*, menu item *New project*.

    * Click radiobutton *Create project from scratch*, button *Next*

    * Textfield *name*: `droolsjbpm`

    * Textfield *Project files location*: `~/projects/droolsjbpm`

    * Checkbox *Create module*: `off`

* Click menu *File*, menu item *New module*

    * Radiobutton *Import from external model*, button *Next*, button *Next*

    * Textfield *Root directory*: `~/projects/droolsjbpm/guvnor`

        * That is the directory that contains the multiproject `pom.xml` file from a project base directory.

    * Button *Next*, check in the *Selected profiles* `notSoaProfile` and `fullProfile`, button *Next*, button *Finish*.

    * Go grab a coffee while it's indexing.

    * Repeat if you want to work on more than 1 droolsjbpm project.

Note: Don't use the `maven-idea-plugin` on the command line with `mvn`: it's dead.

Configuring IntelliJ
--------------------

* Force language level 5 (not 6), to fail-fast on implemented interface methods that are annotated with `@Override`.

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Project Structure*

    * Click list item *Modules*, for each module, tab *Sources*, combobox *Language level* should be automatically set to `5.0 ...`

* Avoid that changes in some resources are ignored in the next run/debug (and you are forced to use mvn)

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *Compiler*, textfield *Resource patterns*: change to `!?*.java` (remove other content)

* Avoid a `StackOverflowError` when building

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *Compiler*, tree item *Java Compiler*, textfield *Additional command line parameters*

    * Add ` -J-Xss1024k` so it becomes something like `-target 1.5 -J-Xss1024k`

* Include files with non-default extensions in your searches and refactors

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *File Types*, in the list *Recognized File Types*:

        * Next to list *Recognized File Types*, click on the button *Add...*

            * Textfield *name*: `DRL files`

            * Textfield *Line comment*: `//`

            * Textfield *Block comment start*: `/*`

            * Textfield *Block comment end*: `*/`

            * Check the checkboxes *Support paired braces*, *Support paired brackets* and *Support parens*

            * Add some *keywords*: `rule`, `when`, `then`, `end`, ...

            * Click button *ok*

        * Next to the list *Registered Patterns*, use the button *Add...*:

            * For `DRL files`, add `*.drl`, `*.mvel`, `*.drt`, `*.dslr`

            * For `Text files`, add `*.md`

            * For `Properties files`, add `*.dsl`

            * For `XML Files`, add `*.rf`

* Optionally import one of our code styles:

    * If you don't do this, you need to set the file encoding and number of spaces correctly manually.

    * Choose the correct one from `droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/ide-configuration`

        * The `droolsjbpm-knowledge` and `drools` repositories use original, not java-conventions.

    * Copy to `~/.IntelliJIdea10/config/codestyles/` (on mac: `~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea10/config/codestyles/`)

    * Restart, open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *Code Style* and select it.

* Set the correct file encoding (UTF-8 except for properties files) and end-of-line characters (unix):

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *Code Style*, tree item *General*

        * Combobox *Line separator (for new files)*: `Unix`

    * Click tree item *File Encodings*

        * Combobox *IDE Encoding*: `UTF-8`

        * Combobox *Default encoding for properties files*: `ISO-8859-1`

            * Note: normal i18n properties files must be in `ISO-8859-1` as specified by the java `ResourceBundle` contract.

                * Note on note: GWT i18n properties files override that and must be in `UTF-8` as specified by the GWT contract.

* Set the correct number of spaces when pressing tab:

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *Code Style*, tree item *General*

    * Click tab *Java*

        * Checkbox *Use tab character*: `off`

        * Textfield *Tab size*: `4`

        * Textfield *Indent*: `4`

        * Textfield *Continuation indent*: `8`

    * Open tab *XML*

        * Checkbox *Use tab character*: `off`

        * Textfield *Tab size*: `2`

        * Textfield *Indent*: `2`

        * Textfield *Continuation indent*: `4`

* Set the correct file headers (do not include @author or a meaningless javadoc):

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *File templates*, tab *Includes*, list item `File Header`

    * Remove the line *@author Your Name*.

        * We do not accept `@author` lines in source files, see FAQ below.

    * Remove the entire javadoc as automatically templated data is meaningless.

* Set the correct license header

    * Open menu *File*, menu item *Settings*

    * Click tree item *Copyright*, tree item *Copyright profiles*

        * Click button *+* to add a *Copyright profile*

Team communication
==================

To develop a great project as a team, we need to communicate efficiently as a team.

* **[Subscribe to the dev list](http://www.jboss.org/drools/lists) and check it daily.**

    * Send a summary of every important organizational or structural decision to the dev list.

    * If you (accidentally) push a change that can severely hinder or disrupt other developers (such as a compilation failure), notify the dev list.

* Subscribe to the RSS feeds.

    * **It's recommend to subscribe at least to the RSS feeds of the project/repositories you're working on.**

    * Prefer an RSS reader which shows which RSS articles you've already read, such as:
        
        * Thunderbird

            * Open menu *File*, menu item *Subscribe*.
            
            * Tip: create a new, separate directory for each feed: some feeds (such as about the project you are working on) are more important to you than others.

        * [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader)

    * Subscribe to jira issue changes:

            * Right click in the lower left corner on the *All* feed link, menu item *Add link to jenkins build monitor*.

        * Otherwise, check [the hudson website](https://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/view/Drools%20jBPM/) often.

            * Note: the public hudson is a mirror of the VPN internal Red Hat hudson and is sometimes stale.

                * If you think this can be the case, check the build times.

* Join us on IRC: irc.codehaus.org #drools #jbpm #guvnor

Writing documentation
=====================

* Optionally install a DocBook editor to write documentation more comfortably, such as:

    * [XMLmind Personal Edition](http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/download.shtml)

        * Open menu *Options*, menu item *Preferences...*.

        * Click tree item *Save*

            * Combobox *Encoding*: `UTF-8`

            * Textfield *Identation*: `2`

            * Textfield *Max. line length*: `120`

            * Checkbox *Before saving, make a backup copy of the file*: `off`

                * To avoid committing backups to source control.

                * Source control history is better than backups.

* To generate the html and pdf output run maven with `-Dfull`:

        $ cd droolsjbpm
        $ cd guvnor/guvnor-docs
        $ mvn clean install -Dfull
        ...
        $ firefox target/docbook/publish/en-US/html_single/index.html

* **[Read and follow the documentation guidelines](documentation-guidelines.txt).**

* The Drools Expert manual uses railroad diagrams.
    
    These are generated from a BNF file into images files with the application
    [Ebnf2ps, Automatic Railroad Diagram Drawing](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~thiemann/haskell/ebnf2ps/)

Releasing
=========

Expecting a release
-------------------

* Use a non-SNAPSHOT version for all dependencies. Get those dependencies (for example mvel) released if needed.
    * The MVEL release usually becomes a blocker for the Drools release, try to get MVEL released one week before the Drools release. This way you have time to test with the real thing.

* Run findbugs on all projects:

        $ mvn site -DskipTests
        $ firefox */target/site/findbugs.html

* Releasing Drools with or without jBPM?

    * If jBPM must not be released, then do this in any shell before running the first release command:

            $ export withoutJbpm=true

    * Furthermore, verify that the `droolsjbpm-parent` pom's properties are not using a SNAPSHOT version of jBPM.

Creating a release branch
-------------------------

A release branch name should always end with `.x` so it looks different from a tag name and a topic branch name.

* Simply use the script `script/release/create-release-branches.sh` with the drools and jbpm *release branch name*:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/create-release-branches.sh 5.2.x 5.1.x

* Switch back and forth from master to the release branches for all git repositories

    * If you haven't made the branches yourself, first make sure your local repository knows about them:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh fetch

    * Switch to master with `script/git-checkout-all.sh`

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-checkout-all.sh master master

    * Update master to the next SNAPSHOT version to avoid clashing the artifacts on nexus of master and the release branch:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/update-version-all.sh 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT 5.2.0.SNAPSHOT 5.3.0-SNAPSHOT 5.3.0.SNAPSHOT 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT 5.1.0.SNAPSHOT 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT 5.2.0.SNAPSHOT

    * Switch back to the *release branch name* with `script/git-checkout-all.sh` with drools and jbpm *release branch name*:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-checkout-all.sh 5.2.x 5.1.x

    * Do a sanity check with `grep -lir "5.2.x" * | grep -v "target"`. This lists all the files that are still using the old version, if there are any.

Releasing from a release branch
-------------------------------

* To produce the distribution zips, build with `-Dfull`:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh -Dfull clean install

    * Warning: Use JDK 1.6, because in JDK 1.5 the module `guvnor-repository-connector-modeshape` is not build.

    * Warning: Verify that workspace contains no uncommitted changes or rogue module directories of older branches:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh status

        * Otherwise the sources in a distribution zip might contain archived module directories with old binaries.

* Do a sanity check of the artifacts by running each runExamples.sh from the zips.

    * The distribution zips are in the directory `droolsjbpm-build-distribution/droolsjbpm-uber-distribution/target`.

If everything is perfect (compiles, hudson is all blue and sanity checks succeed):

* Define the version and adjust the sources accordingly:

    * First define the version.

        * There are only 4 acceptable patterns:

            * `major.minor.micro.Alpha[n]`, for example `1.2.3.Alpha1`

            * `major.minor.micro.Beta[n]`, for example `1.2.3.Beta1`

            * `major.minor.micro.CR[n]`, for example `1.2.3.CR1`
            
            * `major.minor.micro.Final`, for example `1.2.3.Final`

        * The OSGi version is exactly the same as the pom version.

        * See the [JBoss version conventions](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossProjectVersioning)

            * Not following those, for example `1.2.3` or `1.2.3.M1` results in OSGi eclipse updatesite corruption.

        * **The version has 3 numbers and qualifier. The qualifier is case-sensitive and starts with a capital.**

            * Use the exact same version everywhere (especially in URL's).

    * Adjust the version in the poms, manifests and other eclipse stuff.

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/update-version-all.sh 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT 5.2.0.SNAPSHOT 5.2.0.Final 5.2.0.Final 5.1.0-SNAPSHOT 5.1.0.SNAPSHOT 5.1.0.Final 5.1.0.Final

        * Note: the arguments are `droolsOldVersion droolsOldOsgiVersion droolsNewVersion droolsNewOsgiVersion jbpmOldVersion jbpmOldOsgiVersion jbpmNewVersion jbpmNewOsgiVersion`.

        * WARNING: FIXME the update-version-all script does not work correctly if you are releasing a hotfix version.

        * Commit those changes (so you can tag them properly):

                $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh commit -m"Set release version: 5.2.0.Final"

    * Update the *Compatibility matrix* in `droolsjbpm-knowledge/droolsjbpm-introduction-docs/src/main/docbook/en-US/Chapter-Compatibility/Chapter-Compatibility_matrix.xml`.

        * Cherry pick that change to master too.

* Create the tag locally. The arguments are the Drools version, the jBPM version:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/git-tag-locally-all.sh 5.2.0.Final 5.1.0.Final

* Deploy the artifacts:

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/mvn-all.sh -Dfull -DskipTests clean deploy

    * The release skips the tests because jbpm and guvnor have random failing tests

* Go to [nexus](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus), menu item *Staging repositories*, find your staging repository.

    * Look at the files in the repository

    * Button *close*

        * This will validate the nexus rules. If any fail: fix the issues, and force retag locally.

* Do another sanity check of the artifacts by running the examples from the zips.

    * Go to `droolsjbpm-build-distribution/droolsjbpm-uber-distribution/target` and check the zips

        * Start the `examples.sh` script for drools, droolsjbpm-integration and drools-planner

        * Deploy the guvnor jboss-as-7.0 war to guvnor and surf to it:

            * Install the mortgages examples, build it and run the test scenario's

        * Warning: the `manual` dir in some zips have been known to have zip problems: they look fine zipped, but are empty unzipped.

            * This regularly occurs on ge0ffrey's machine for `droolsjbpm-integration` and `drools-planner` on the directories `manual` and `javadocs`.

            * Solution: unzip them, grab the good content from the relevant *-distribution module and rezip it (yes nexus zip's are wrong).

* This is **the point of no return**.

    * Warning: The slightest change after this requires the use of the next version number!

        * **NEVER TAG OR DEPLOY A VERSION THAT ALREADY EXISTS AS A PUSHED TAG OR A DEPLOY!!!**

            * Except deploying `SNAPSHOT` versions.

            * Git tags are cached on developer machines forever and are never refreshed.

            * Maven non-snapshot versions are cached on developer machines and proxies forever and are never refreshed.

        * So even if the release is broken, do not reuse the same version number! Create a hotfix version.

* Define the next development version an adjust the sources accordingly:

    * Define the next development version on the branch from which you are releasing.

        * There are only 1 acceptable pattern:

            * `major.minor.micro-SNAPSHOT`, for example `1.2.0-SNAPSHOT` or `1.2.1-SNAPSHOT`

        * Warning: This release branch should never have the same SNAPSHOT version as master or another branch.

            * If you're releasing a Final, increment the micro number, not the minor number.

        * The OSGi version ends in `.SNAPSHOT` instead of `-SNAPSHOT`.

    * Adjust the version in the poms, manifests and other eclipse stuff:

            $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/update-version-all.sh 5.2.0.Final 5.2.0.Final  5.3.0-SNAPSHOT 5.3.0.SNAPSHOT 5.1.0.Final 5.1.0.Final 5.2.0-SNAPSHOT 5.2.0.SNAPSHOT

        * Commit those changes:

                $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh commit -m"Set next development version: 5.3.0-SNAPSHOT"

        * Push all changes, both the first and the last version change commit, to the repository *together*:

                $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/git-all.sh push

* Push the local tag to the remote blessed repository.

        $ droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/script/release/git-push-tag-all.sh 5.2.0.Final 5.1.0.Final

* Release your staging repository on [nexus](https://repository.jboss.org/nexus)

    * Button *release*

* Go to [jira](https://issues.jboss.org) and for each of our JIRA projects (JBRULES, GUVNOR, JBPM):

    * Open menu item *Administration*, link *Manage versions*, release the version.

    * Create a new version if needed. There should be at least 2 unreleased non-FUTURE versions.

* Upload the zips, documentation and javadocs and update the website.

    * Go to `droolsjbpm-build-distribution/droolsjbpm-uber-distribution/target`.

    * `download_jboss_org` goes into [download.jboss.org](http://download.jboss.org/drools/release/)

        * Update [the download webpage](http://www.jboss.org/drools/downloads) accordingly

    * `docs_jboss_org` goes into [docs.jboss.org](http://download.docs.org/drools/release/)

        * Use `documentation_table.txt` to update [the documentation webpage](http://www.jboss.org/drools/documentation).

Announcing the the release
--------------------------

* Create a blog entry on [the droolsjbpm blog](http://blog.athico.com/)

    * Include a direct link to the new and noteworthy section and to that blog entry in all other correspondence.

    * Twitter and Google+ the links.

        * Most people just want to read the new and noteworthy, so link that first.

    * Mail the links to the user list.

* If it's a final release:

    * Notify TheServerSide and Dzone's Daily Dose.

FAQ

* Why do you not accept `@author` lines in your source code?

    * Because the author tags in the java files are a maintenance nightmare

        * A large percentage is wrong, incomplete or inaccurate.

        * Most of the time, it only contains the original author. Many files are completely refactored/expanded by other authors.

        * Git is accurate, that is the canonical source to find the correct author.

    * Because the author tags promote *code ownership*, which is bad in the long run.

        * If people work on a piece they perceive as being owned by someone else, they tend to:

            * only fix what they are assigned to fix, instead of everything that's broken

            * discard responsibility if that code doesn't work properly

            * be scared of stepping on the feet of the owner.
